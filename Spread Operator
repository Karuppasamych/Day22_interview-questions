The spread operator is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6.
It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements.
The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects.
Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.


let array1 = ['h', 'e', 'y'];
let array2 = [...array1];
console.log(array2);
